Wikipedia Database Graph

  This project was for my final exam of my course on Data Structures. The dataset we used was for moderator elections on
  wikipedia. We had to create a graph that tracked the results of the various elections. We had to track how many times
  a user voted and whether it was a vote for, neutral, or against the nominated user. We also had to track how many
  votes a user recieved when put up for election and how many of them were votes for, neutral, or against.
